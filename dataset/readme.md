# SDA Image Dataset
We are pleased to announce the release of our surface defects of apples (SDA) image dataset. This dataset has been created to support research in the field of agricultural automation and apple sorting system. The dataset contains a collection of high-resolution images of apples with surface defects, which can be used for various applications such as image recognition, machine learning, and computer vision.

The images in this dataset are in standard TIFF format with a size of 2448*2048 pixels. The resolution is 96DPI and each file has a size of 14.3MB. The dataset has been carefully annotated with labels indicating normal and defective apples. In the future, we will also publish additional datasets carefully annotated with labels indicating the location and type of each defect for research such as object detection. 
The dataset is publicly available and can be used for research purposes. However, due to the large size of the entire dataset, we are unable to upload it all to GitHub at once. If you are interested in obtaining the dataset, please make a separate request by contacting us at juhwanlee@jnu.ac.kr and we will provide it to you via email.

## Contents
The SDA image dataset contains a total of 5,000 images of apples with surface defects. The defects present in the images include bruises, scabs, cuts, and insect damage. Each image in the dataset has been annotated with labels indicating the type and location of the defect.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for various applications such as image recognition, machine learning, and computer vision. Researchers can use this dataset to train and test their models, algorithms, and systems. The dataset is publicly available and can be used for research purposes. If you use this dataset in your research, we kindly request that you cite our paper in your publications.

## Contact
For any inquiries or requests regarding the dataset, please contact us at juhwanlee@jnu.ac.kr. We would be happy to answer any questions or provide further information about the dataset.

Thank you for your interest in our SDA image dataset. We hope that it will be useful for your research.
